# Health-Tracker-Smartwatch-Business-Expansion-Data-Analysis

## Objective

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in data analysis using Excel, SQL, Power BI and Python.  The objective is to identify the state with the best potential for business expansion. These are the analytical tasks for each tool:

**SQL:**
1.	Calculate the total profit, research & development expenditure, administration expenditure, and marketing expenditure for each state.
2.	Rank the states based on their total profit and identify the top 5 states.
3.	Calculate the average health spending, property prices, state income, and population for the top 5 states and compare them.

**Excel:**
1.	Create a pivot table to summarize the total profit, research & development expenditure, administration expenditure, and marketing expenditure for each state.
2.	Create a bar chart to compare the total profit for the top 5 states.
3.	Create a scatter plot to analyze the correlation between the state income and property prices for the top 5 states.

**Power BI:**
1.	Create a visual to show the total profit for each state and add a filter to show the top 5 states.
2.	Create a map to show the average health spending, property prices, state income, and population for the top 5 states.
3.	Create a dashboard to compare the health spending, property prices, state income, and population for the top 5 states.

**Python:**
1.	Calculate the correlation between the total profit and health spending, property prices, state income, and population for each state. Use the df.corr() method for this task.
2.	Create a bar chart using Matplotlib/Seaborn to compare the total profit for the top 5 states.
3.	Create a scatter plot using Matplotlib/Seaborn to analyze the correlation between the state income and property prices for the top 5 states.

**Business Metrics:**
Calculate Financial Viability Metrics from Competitor Companies.
